Last month I hosted a webinar with my Box UK colleague Kevin Greer on Product Thinking for Wales Tech Week. It's a helpful introduction to some different ways of thinking about development and how we've put some of that into practice.

Some of the topics include:

- What is Product Thinking?
- Creating an effective Product Vision
- MVP vs Smallest Successful Release
- How to avoid becoming a feature factory
- Why it's important to never stop learning
