title: Omnifocus Plugin Duplicate for list
categories: [writings]
---

I've just released a plugin for Omnifocus called [Duplicate for List](https://github.com/samknight/omnifocus-automation-scripts). This plugins allows you to duplicate any task and replace a placeholder with values from a list.

I'm currently managing 8 developers which has increased the number of times I need to completed certain actions. Whether its completing 1:1s or ensuring I've communicated key information; I found myself re-typing the same task into Omnifocus many times, only slightly editing to add the name of the team member.

The list entered during the first run will be remembered for all future runs. It can be reset by running the plugin whilst holding down the option key. This also works for nested tasks, just highlight the all the tasks to be duplicated.

Share and enjoy
