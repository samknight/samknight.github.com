title: Inconsistent swipe actions in Mail (iOS and iPadOS)
---

**Resolved**

**I have managed to resolve this issue thanks to my colleague Rich, who linked me to this [answer](https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/25/delete-gmail-on-iphone-instead-of-archive/)**

I've recently been using an iPad much more frequently than I have in the past and during this time my frustration over swipe actions in mail has grown into all consuming anger.

Swipe actions in all apps but especially when triaging mail should be the simplest, muscle memory function that can exist with touch devices. Instead I have to double check I am swiping the right way every time.

For my iPad, I have to swipe right but on my iPhone I need to left.

## Configuration

As you can see both devices are set up to archive on swipe right and both are linked to the same fastmail email account.
