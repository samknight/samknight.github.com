I work as a consultant helping organisations with their technology strategy, innovation and delivery.

I haved worked in software for over a decade in a variety of roles from developer to Technical Director of a health tech startup delivering innovative software for the NHS.

I've also worked in public policy and service delivery as a Councillor and Deputy Cabinet Member for Technology, Innovation and Skills.

I've worked in wide range of sectors from finance, sport, membership organisations, charities, health to e-commerce. My passion though is for projects that improve society.

I am currently working as a Solution Architect and Agile Coach at [Box UK](https://boxuk.com).
