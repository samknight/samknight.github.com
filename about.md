I am Technical Director of [Substrakt Health](https://substrakthealth.com). We are a technology company enabling the primary care sector to innovate the way in which they provide services, using digital tools.

During the span of my career I have worked as a Developer, Business Analyst, Local Councillor and as the Deputy Cabinet Member for Technology, Innovation and Skills at Cardiff Council. The experience I've gained in these posts, working on some amazing projects, has provided me with the capability to deliver digital projects in an agile and effective way. 

I'm passionate about the importance of citizen engagement, and am enjoying my role in advancing and improving healthcare services. 

I like to be involved in projects that help improve public services and society.
